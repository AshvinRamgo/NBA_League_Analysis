# NBA_League_Analysis and Visualization

## Description
This project involves analyzing and visualizing NBA team and player data from 2000 to 2023. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Additionally, linear regression is used to identify trends and patterns in the data. The project aims to provide insights into team performance, player statistics, and overall trends in the NBA.

## Data Source
- The NBA Overall Team Data from 2000-2023 was pulled as a CSV file from: [Kaggle NBA Teams Stat 2000-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bluedreamv1b3/nba-teams-stat-2000-2023/data)
- The NBA 2023 Player data was pulled as a CSV file from: [Kaggle NBA Teams Stat 2000-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bluedreamv1b3/nba-teams-stat-2000-2023/data)

## Data Cleaning
Using Pandas and NumPy, the data was cleaned:
- Handling null values in the dataset and altering some non-null values for easier analysis.
- Changing names of teams and positions from abbreviations to full names for visualization.
- Formatting data, removing unnecessary columns, and sorting it as required.
